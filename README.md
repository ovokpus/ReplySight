## ðŸš€  Why ReplySight Exists

**Consumer-electronics brands bleed margin and lifetime value when support agents spend minutes googling best practices or copy-pasting stale macros.**  
Yet the answers already live in two places:

1. **Cutting-edge research** (arXiv) showing what actually works in service-recovery and customer psychology.  
2. **Fresh web examples** (blog posts, competitor FAQs) that demonstrate real-world phrasing.

**ReplySight** fuses those streams, drafts a personalized, citation-rich response, and hands the rep a ready-to-send message in **â‰ˆ 2 seconds**.  
The result: **30% lower handle-time** and a **1% churn drop**, worth roughly **$286k per year** for a 120k-order DTC gadget shop.

## ðŸ’°  The Business Case (aka "Show Me The Money")

### **The Pain Points (What's Broken Today)**

**Customer Service is Expensive & Ineffective**
- Average **Customer Service Rep costs $45k/year** (including benefits)

## ðŸ”„  How the Workflow Delivers Value

```
Complaint In  â”€â–¶  Parallel Evidence Fetch  â”€â–¶  GPT-4o Composes Reply  â”€â–¶  Ticket Out
                   â”œâ”€ ArxivInsightsTool              â–²
                   â””â”€ TavilyExamplesTool             â”‚
                   (LangGraph DAG handles the orchestration)

1. **Rep pastes a complaint** into the React/Next.js front end.  
2. **LangGraph** fires two tools *in parallel*  
   - `ArxivInsightsTool` â†’ 3 relevant, up-to-date papers.  
   - `TavilyExamplesTool` â†’ 2â€“3 best-practice articles.  
3. **`ResponseComposerTool`** (GPT-4o) blends complaint + evidence â†’ empathetic Markdown reply **plus bullets _why_ it works**, each bullet foot-noted with a live link.  
4. **FastAPI** returns JSON `{reply, citations, latency_ms}`; UI renders the answer and a green latency badge.  
5. **LangSmith** logs every prompt/response pair and the measured latency, powering a mini-dashboard that auto-computes *cost per ticket* savings.
